Exercise 10.1 (foldr)
In this exercise the goal is to make an implementation of foldr. Python's
reduce function is often called foldl in other programming languages, and given
a function f and a list [x1, ..., xn] computes f(···f(f(x1,x2),x3)···,xn). The
function foldr should instead compute f(x1,(···f(xn-2,f(xn-1,xn))···)). This
function does not appear in the Python standard library but is standard in
other programming languages, in particular functional programming languages
like Haskell and ML. The difference between folding left and right is
illustrated by applying the power function to the list [2, 2, 2, 2], where
((2**2)**2)**2 = 256 whereas 2**(2**(2**2)) = 65536.

import functools
foldl = functools.reduce

def foldr(f, L):
    < your code >

print(foldl(lambda x,y: x**y, [2,2,2,2]))   # prints 256
print(foldr(lambda x,y: x**y, [2,2,2,2]))   # should print 65536
print(foldr(lambda x,y: x**y, [2,2,2,2,2])) # value with 19729 digits
Note. You can implement foldr both with a loop and recursively.

    if len(L) == 2:
        return f(L[0], L[1])

    return f(L[0], foldr(f, L[1:]))
